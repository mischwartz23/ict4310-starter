  - The "action" attributes in the form determine what server URL to send to.
  - The URL has the following parts:
    a) the protocol (http or https) followed by ://
    b) the host (usually an FQDN, but here just localhost)
    c) the (option) port number. The default is 80 for http and 443 for https
    d) The path, representing the resource requested on that host's web server.
  - All these can be modified to meet the caller's need.

    <h1>Form</h1>
    <p>
      This is a web page with a form that will say hello to you if it works.
    </p>
    <h2>GET</h2>
    <p>
      This form submits a "GET" request to the server. All this does is ask
      for this page back again but puts the form parameter in the URL.
      Try entering a name in the box and clicking the "GET Request" button.
      Then look in the URL and you'll see it says "form.html?name=value"
      for whatever "value" you entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <form method="GET" action="http://localhost:8000/form">
	       <input type='text' name='name' />
	       <input type='number' name='number' />
	       <input type="submit" value="GET Request" />
      </form>
    </p>
    <h2>POST</h2>
    <p>
      This form submits a "POST" request to the server. It calls a different page
      that it just calls "form" and puts the parameters in the body of the request
      so that you don't see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <form method="POST" action="http://localhost:8000/form">
	       <label>Name</label><input type='text' name='name' />
	       <label>Number</label><input type='number' name='number' />
	       <input type="submit" value="POST Request" />
      </form>
